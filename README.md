# ac-ac-vrms-sampler-breakout.kicad

[AC-AC VRMS sampling](https://openenergymonitor.org/emon/buildingblocks/measuring-voltage-with-an-acac-power-adapter) breakout board based on the circuit used in the [emonPi V1.6](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/Hardware/tree/master/emonPi/emonPi_V1_6)

* changed value of R1 from 10k to 7.5k (using a 12V AC/AC adapter instead of 9V)
* use [buffered voltage bias](https://openenergymonitor.org/emon/buildingblocks/acac-buffered-voltage-bias)
